## Update 10/04/20 - 15:08

Since the last update, we have seen how powerful the Bootstrap classes can be. Some of the advantages of using bootstrap inclued:

1. Each page you design has the potential to be consistant throughout
2. As all of the basic CSS code is written out for you, all you need to do is copy and paste the elements from the web page that you like the looks of and you can instantly use them
3. With Bootstraps 'mobile-first-design', its very easy to be able to accomodate for screens of all sizes

While Boostrap has a comprihensive library of styles to be used, they are all able to be edited to how you would like them to be. 

Disadvantages of Bootstrap include:

1. Learning Curve - While Bootstrap is a great tool in a developers arsenal, it can take time to get to grips with everything it has to offer right away. Taking time away from development and spending it learning the programme instead

css goes at the top to make sure that the user doesnt see an unstyled page and they see the content as they should as early as possible

browser reads html from top to bottom 

JS files might be larger therefore once they are at the bottom, they will load last, hopefully once everuthing else on the page has loaded
